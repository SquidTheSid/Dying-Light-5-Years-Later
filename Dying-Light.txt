Dying Light - 5 years later

Polish developer Techland has been quietly working on games for well over two
decades now.  Yet, outside of a cult following with their Call of Juarez and
Dead Island franchises, they've never really seen mainstream attention. That
is, until their 2015 hit title Dying Light. In many ways, it's an oddity,
releasing years after the undead media craze introduced by Left 4 Dead and The
Walking Dead had ended. However, through years of free updates and addons,
Techland has cultivated a dedicate fanbase. And with the upcoming Dying Light
sequel coming out later this year, what better time to look back on the
original game and see how it has evolved since launch? 

Story:

Generally, I don't care about plot. Most video games have forgettable
narratives with throwaway characters. And Dying Light's no exception. However,
the game is hellbent on interrupting the campaign with scripted walk-n'-talk
segments, so I can't just ignore them. Thus, let's rip off the bandaid now so
we can talk about the rest of the game as quickly as possible.
